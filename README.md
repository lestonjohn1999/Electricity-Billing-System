# Electricity-Billing-System
Config files for my GitHub profile.
The project is a web based application which will be working on cloud where
users can get instant electricity bill and pay them online via credit card. The system
automates the conventional process of paying electricity bill by visiting the place
where users have to stand in queue for paying bill and wait for their turn. The process
is tiresome and time consuming. They even have to wait for the bill being delivered to
their place which sometimes can be delivered late by the delivery boy. Hence the
system is developed to automate the electricity bill calculation and payment for user
convenience.
The purpose of Electricity Billing System using Cloud is to automate the
existing manual system by the help of computerized equipmentâ€™s and full-fledged
computer software, fulfilling their requirements, so that their valuable data/information
can be stored for a longer period with easy accessing and manipulation of the same.
The required software and hardware are easily available and easy to work with.
